No Suspicion Detected 

- I went to the grocery store at 5 PM. I bought milk, eggs, and bread. I paid with my credit card and have the receipt. I drove directly home afterward.

Slightly Suspicious 

- I think I might have seen the suspect near the building, but I'm not completely sure. It was dark and I wasn't wearing my glasses. He seemed to be wearing dark clothing, possibly a jacket.

- I was at the park yesterday afternoon, though I don't recall exactly what time. I might have seen someone matching that description, but I wasn't paying close attention to other people there.

Moderately Suspicious 

- Well, I could have been at the store around that time, maybe, I'm not exactly sure. I don't think I saw anything unusual, but then again, I wasn't really looking, you know? There might have been some kind of commotion, but it's hard to recall specifically what happened or who was there.

- I possibly saw someone who could have resembled the suspect, but it was getting dark and I didn't get a good look at his face. He might have been wearing a red shirt, or possibly a blue one. I'm not entirely sure about the time, but it wasn't early in the morning and it wasn't late at night.

Highly Suspicious 

- I might have been near the area at that time, but I can't really say for certain. I don't think I saw anything unusual, but then again, I wasn't really paying attention. I could have seen someone matching that description, but there were a lot of people around and I don't remember clearly. It might have been raining, or maybe it was just cloudy. I'm not very good with remembering exact times and dates, you know? I probably didn't see anything important, but if I did, I would definitely tell you. I'm just not sure if I was even looking in that direction, to be honest.
